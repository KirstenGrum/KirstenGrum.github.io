<!--below is body guts: remeber to ask mentor about line inbetween above nav words how do I get it in there to not show as part of btn-->

<section> 

<!--this section is main copy (minus p tag, thta will go on front page - a color box will sit on top of hero image to pop words off of main image. -->
<img id="home_pg_middle" src="images/homepgstrip.jpg" alt="Stip in middle of homepage" title="texture">

	<h5>WELCOME TO MY</h5>
	<h1 id="slogan">PORTFOLIO</h1>
	<h3>integrity &middot; passion &middot; art</h3>

	<P> My homepage for the final will most likely look a bit differnt than this - wanted to play around with CSS on this page as well as do the assignemt. The gray and logo are overlap images on the background. </P>

	<ul>
	<li>The logo will also be placed on White (I like a more clean look -so ill be using more white and some texture).</li>
	<li>But for the sake of UNIT 3 its up there for now <BR> <br>this will also have a differnt backround that is - not a hero page -- im thinking more along the lines of a long strip or something framed.</li>
	<li> I have some quetions about text placement and a handle of other things.<strong>THANKS So Much !! </strong></li></ul>
