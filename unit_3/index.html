			<P> My homepage for the final will most likely look a bit differnt than this - wanted to play around with CSS on this page as well as do the assignemt. The logo will also be placed on White (I like a more clean look -so ill be using more white.  </P>

			<p> I Have a background in Fine Arts, I prefer to paint in oils - however, I also have experance in acrlyic and watercolor. I also, really enjoy drawing in charcoal and pastels, together. They work really well together - to show differnt dynamics.</P>
